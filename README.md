# Splendia

Splendia is decomposed into 2 parts: 
- a web interface (i.e., the front-end of the project) found in the "front" repository
- a server containing the model and the AIs of the game (i.e., the back-end of the project) found in the "back" repository

To run Splendia, you need to run both the back-end and the front-end.
You can find more information on how to run:
- the back-end in the README file of the "back" repository
- the front-end in the README file of the "front" repository
